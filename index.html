        <h1>Happy Birthday Mommy!</h1>
        <p>Wishing you a birthday filled with the same love, joy, and warmth you so freely share with everyone around you. You have a beautiful way of making people feel seen, valued, and completely at ease—whether it’s through your kindness, your laughter, or just the way you show up wholeheartedly. You go the extra mile not because you have to, but because that’s simply who you are.</p>

        <div class="text"><q>Thank you for being such a light in our lives. We love and deeply appreciate you—not just today, but every day.</q></div>

        <ul>
            <li>May He grant you wisdom to continue walking in grace and purpose,</li>
            <li>Strength to rise above every challenge,</li>
            <li>And joy that refreshes your spirit, even as you refresh others.</li>
            <li>May His favor follow you, His peace fill you, and His love guide you through every step of the year ahead.</li>
